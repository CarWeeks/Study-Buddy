# Study Buddy

## an interactive way to keep studying fun and productive

This application is intended to provide a way for those who often work on computers 
*(computer scientists, computer science students)* to stay productive. The study buddy
is a digital pet that helps manage your **health** and **wellness** as you study/work.

The study buddy is a pet that will have four primary attributes:
- Health
- Food
- Energy
- Happiness

These attributes will interact with one another to create a digital pet that requires
care and attention, with the goal of reminding anyone who has been studying or working
for a while to take a break every once in a while. In addition to taking breaks, the study
buddy will help keep users from feeling lonely while working.

How it will work: the **food** bar will naturally decline as time passes, meaning that 
the user's buddy will get more and more hungry. If the buddy's food bar completely
empties, it will start losing health, and if it runs out of health it will eventually die.
The **health** bar will be non-replenishing, which means once your buddy loses health
you will have to be extra sure not to let it lose anymore!
Your past buddies will then be stored in the Study Buddy Cemetery, a list of all of
your past buddies and how long you were able to keep them alive. You will then be
able to access the cemetery at any time.
The **happiness** bar is much like the health bar, however the user will be able to increase
their pet's happiness by feeding it and keeping it alive longer!
And finally, the energy bar will currently have very little meaning, however in future
additions to the application the **energy** bar will have much more importance. In future
variations, you will be able to play fun mini-games with your buddy which will use energy
and increase happiness at a much faster rate. This will require you to keep your pet fed
so that it will have more energy for future games!

I chose this style of application for myself as well as those around me, school colleagues,
work-place colleagues, and friends! I found that majority of today's world requires the use
of computers, often many hours at a time, and thought it would be beneficial to make their
experience more enjoyable--and even a little-bit fun! This project specifically sparks my
interest as it is a way to make something that people can enjoy and find useful as well as
being a fun personal project that is designed in a way that allows me to add features and
more functions later. The goal is ultimately to help others stay focused while working on 
their computers.
